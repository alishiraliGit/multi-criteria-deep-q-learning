# State construction following Fatemi et al. (2022)

This is the codebase to replicate the results of Fatemi et al. (2022). We currently use this code to replicate their approach for extracting a state representation from MIMIC III 

## How to use

### Step 0) Data Preparation: 

#### Part 1: MIMIC-III Sepsis Cohort

The code used to define, extract and preprocess the patient cohort from MIMIC-III can be found at [https://github.com/microsoft/mimic_sepsis](https://github.com/microsoft/mimic_sepsis). This code produces two CSV files `sepsis_final_data_withTimes.csv` and `sepsis_final_data_RAW_withTimes.csv`.

To replicate the results presented in our paper, it is expected that these two files are accessible via the directory `./data/sepsis_mimiciii/`. 

Then from the root directory, run the following steps (tested on Windows and Linux). All steps depend on the configuration file `config_sepsis.yaml` which is used to define experiment specific parameters as well as the directories where data can be found, artifacts of training and, results are stored. As a default (for illustrative purposes) we name the base experiment as "run1" which is used to create a subfolder.

#### Part 2: Preprocess the extracted trajectories

Run `ipython ./data_process.py`

The patient cohort provided in part 1 is extracted for general purposes. This script places the extracted trajectories into a more convenient format for the DeD learning processes and also constructs independent training, validation and test datasets. It also removes the raw-input columns from the observations (`o:input_total`, `o:input_4hourly`, and `o:max_dose_vaso`), if they are included by the the cohort generator.

### Step 3 Train the State Construction (SC-) Network

Run `ipython ./train_sc_network.py`

Following [Killian, et al.](https://github.com/MLforHealth/rl_representations) we form state representations by processing a sequence of observations, using [AIS](https://github.com/info-structures/ais) prior to and including any time `t` as well as the last selected treatment to form the state `s_t`. The SC-Network is trained to predict the next observation, by reconstructing the latent state representation created via a recurrent encoding module.

> Note: Depending on the architecture, this step can take many hours to completion. 


### Step 4 Create Path file 

Run `python build_state_reward_data.py`

The script creates Path files constructing states according to the network trained in step 3.

# Medical Dead-ends and Learning to Identify High-risk States and Treatments

Machine learning has successfully framed many sequential decision making problems as either supervised prediction, or optimal decision-making policy identification via reinforcement learning. In data-constrained offline settings, both approaches may fail as they assume fully optimal behavior or rely on exploring alternatives that may not exist. Even if optimality is not attainable in such constrained cases, negative outcomes in data can be used to identify behaviors to avoid, thereby guarding against overoptimistic decisions in safety-critical domains that may be significantly biased due to reduced data availability. Along these lines we introduce an approach that identifies possible "dead-ends" of a state space. We focus on the condition of patients in the intensive care unit, where a "medical dead-end" indicates that a patient will expire, regardless of all potential future treatment sequence. We frame the discovery of these dead-ends as an RL problem, training three independent deep neural models for automated state construction, dead-end discovery and confirmation. 

In this repository, we provide the code used develop a novel RL-based method, Dead-end Discovery (DeD), presented in the paper ["Medical Dead-ends and Learning to Identify High-risk States and Treatments"](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/26405399c51ad7b13b504e74eb7c696c-Abstract.html) published at [NeurIPS 2021](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021). DeD focuses on identifying _treatments to avoid_ as opposed to what treatment to select as is typical in RL-based approaches to sequential decision making in healthcare. Our goal in publishing this code is to facilitate reproducibility of our paper in hopes of motivating further research utilizing the DeD framework in safety-critical domains.

## Responsible AI Transparency Information 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed. Creating a system that is fit for its intended purpose requires an understanding of how the technology works, its capabilities and limitations, and how to achieve the best performance. Microsoft has a broad effort to put our AI principles into practice. To find out more, seeâ€¯[Responsible AI principles from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai). 

### Use of this code 

Our goal in publishing this code is to facilitate reproducibility of our paper in hopes of motivating further research utilizing the DeD framework in safety-critical domains. This code should not be used in clinical settings to influence treatment decisions. 

### Project data 

This project uses a generated cohort from the publicly available MIMIC III (version 1.4) dataset. The main data is available at [physionet.org](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) and all the details and the code for generating the cohort is available at [Sepsis Cohort](https://github.com/microsoft/mimic_sepsis). For more information see `Step 0` from the `How to use` section bellow. 

### Fairness and Responsible AI testing 

At Microsoft, we strive to empower every person on the planet to do more. An essential part of this goal is working to create technologies and products that are fair and inclusive. Fairness is a multi-dimensional, sociotechnical topic and impacts many different aspects of our work.  

When systems are deployed, Responsible AI testing should be performed to ensure safe and fair operation for the specific use case. No Responsible AI testing has been done to evaluate this method including validating fair outcomes across different groups of people. Responsible AI testing should be done before using this code in any production scenario.

## Requirements

We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) distribution for python dependencies. The code should work will any recent version. In addition, the following packages are required:

- Pytorch (https://pytorch.org/) -> All recent versions should work. Tested on 1.8 and newers. 
- Click (`pip install click`) -> All recent versions should work. Tested on 6.5 and newers.
- Pyprind (`pip install PyPrind`) -> All versions should work. 


### Step 2) Train the Dead-end (D-) and Recovery (R-) Networks

Run `ipython ./train_rl.py -- -f "./results/run1"`

Based on the MDP formulation introduced in the paper, we train two independent DQN models to discover and confirm dead-ends and identify treatments that may leave a patient toward these unfavorable states. The networks are trained using the DDQN approach introduced by [van Hasselt, et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461) which can be replaced by any appropriate offline RL method. Following [Fatemi, et al.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/fatemi19a.html) we also use bootstrap clipping to mitigate value overflow.

### Step 3) Aggregate and Analyze the Results

#### Part 1) Results aggregation

Run `ipython ./stats/make_plot_data.py`

This script takes the trained D- and R-Networks with the embedded states of the test set to aggregate results and identify potentially high-risk states and treatments. In a generated `./plots` folder two results artifacts are saved:
 - `flag_data.pkl` contains information about states along a patient trajectory that are flagged as medium or high-risk.
 -  `data_value.pkl` contains information about the values of the D- and R- Networks along the step-by-step patient trajectories.

#### Part 2) Generate Figures

 - Run `ipython ./stats/circular_hist.py` to produce the circular histogram in Figure 2.
 - Run `ipython ./stats/base_analysis.py` to aggregate trends of the features and D- + R-Networks, as done in Figure 3.
 - Run `ipython ./stats/make_hist.py` to create the Appendix Figs. A5 and A6 + a raw version of Figure 2.
 - Run `ipython ./stats/tsne.py` to reproduce the T-SNE plots in the Appendix and also generates a list of informative negative trajectories saved to `./plots/good_neg_trajs.yaml`

All following scripts depend on the list of informative negative trajectories: `./plots/good_neg_trajs.yaml`:
 - Run `ipython ./stats/colour_maps.py` to reproduce the colour-maps of Figure 4 and any other desired trajectory from `good_neg_trajs`.
 - Run `ipython ./stats/patients_obs.py` to reproduce the top panel of Figure 4 and any other desired trajectory from `good_neg_trajs`.
 - Run `ipython ./stats/prediction.py` to reproduce the tables found in the appendix (produced in LaTeX format)
